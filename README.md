## [Predicting Heart Disease - Classification Project](https://github.com/Jimmy90s/Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning-Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/Predicting%20Heart%20Disease%20-%20Classification%20Project)
Milestone project from Complete Machine Learning and Data Science - Zero to Mastery course.

  * The project is to build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether or not someone has a Heart Disease based on their medical attributes.
  * using data from Heart Disease Data Set of UCI - [kaggle version](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/heart-disease-uci/data)
